**Chee - Live Chess Analysis**

## Data Collection

Chee does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All chess analysis runs entirely in your browser using a bundled Stockfish WebAssembly engine.

## Storage

Chee uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save your preferences (theme, number of analysis lines, search depth). This data stays in your browser and syncs across your Chrome devices via your Google account. No third party can access it.

## Permissions

- **storage** -- Save and sync user preferences.
- **Host permissions (chess.com, lichess.org)** -- Read the chess board from the page DOM to generate analysis. No page content is collected or sent anywhere.

## Third Parties

Chee does not communicate with any external server. There are no analytics, tracking, or advertising.
