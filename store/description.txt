Chee adds a real-time analysis panel to your chess games on Chess.com and Lichess.org.

It runs Stockfish (one of the strongest chess engines) entirely in your browser using WebAssembly — no server, no account, no data sent anywhere.

Features:
• Multi-line analysis — see the top 3-5 best moves and continuations
• Adjustable search depth (19-22 ply)
• Eval bar showing who's winning at a glance
• Arrow overlays on the board for suggested moves
• Move classifications — Brilliant, Crazy, Best, Excellent, Good, Inaccuracy, Mistake, Blunder
• Crazy sacrifice detection — flags material sacrifices that maintain evaluation
• Blunder guard — warns when you click a piece not in any top engine line
• Eval score chart — SVG area chart plotting eval over the game
• PGN export — copy annotated PGN with eval comments and classification symbols
• Accuracy tracker — running accuracy percentage in the status bar
• Tactical insights — dashed arrows show the best move after Mistakes and Blunders
• Pre-move hints — see the engine's best move or classification-based hint arrows
• Opening name display — ECO opening lookup for recognized positions
• Copy FEN to clipboard with one click
• Minimize or hide the panel when you don't need it
• Catppuccin theme system — Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha, or auto-match the site theme

Supported sites:
• chess.com — live games (/game/*, /play/*)
• lichess.org — all game pages

All analysis runs locally in your browser. No data is collected or transmitted.
